# Lab 6 Info: Creating a To-Do List
### 10/29/18

This web application allows you to make a to-do list by inputting to-do list items and the date they need to be completed by. If the date has already passed, a red border will show up around your list items so that you know the date has passed. You can click on the red X to remove a list item. If you refresh your page, your list items will remain on the page thanks to local storage.

Thank you Marty for giving us such a clear example to follow! This web app is pretty amazing...getting to see how all these different modules interact based on user actions and events.
